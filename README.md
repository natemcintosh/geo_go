Learning Go(lang) and testing out Github copilot

This repository is about learning the Go language and its tooling (e.g. testing, benchmarking, building). 

It's also a fun way to test out [Github's Copilot](https://copilot.github.com). For the most part, Copilot 
has been super useful with things like boilerplate code for testing and benchmarking. In less complicated
cases, it usually gets the logic as well. I've found that documenting my intent with good docstrings has 
also really helped it.
